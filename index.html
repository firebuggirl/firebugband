In the final analysis, FireBug are out to establish a new game, and people want to hear what all the noise is about. In so doing, FireBug have performed at CMJ in New York City, and were showcased at NorthByNortheast in Toronto, and recently at SXSW 2013 in Austin the largest music conference in North America.</p><p>FireBug have toured the UK three times, with a recent memorable performance in Knebworth at the sold out 2010 Sonisphere Festival with Iron Maiden, Iggy and the Stooges, Alice In Chains, The Cult, Good Charlotte, Papa Roach and many other large acts. In London, FireBug has performed in famous venues such as Dublin Castle, The Halfmoon and The Rhythm Factory. They were voted best DIY songwriters and Winner of the UK New Music Video Awards, and have won Best International Act two years in a row (2009 & 2010) at the UK Exposure Music Awards (sponsored by ToursDates.co.uk).</p><p>FireBug also has performed many shows in New Orleans including 2010 Satchmo Festival, and a benefit concert Stand Up for Haiti. The highly acclaimed NewOrleans.com and The Vinyl District did a spotlight on them performing in the French Quarter on Royal and St. Ann for the French Quarter Festival. FireBug recently performed in Downtown New Orleans for the New Orleans Downtown Arts & Music Festival in Lafayette Square and performed two showcases for the 2012 New Orleans Fringe Festival.. Other New Orleans venues include One Eyed Jacks, Howlin' Wolf, Siberia, Hi-Ho Lounge, House Of Blues and Circle Bar. On the band’s schedule are famous venues like the Viper Room in West Hollywood, California; The Echo in Los Angeles, One Eyed Jacks in New Orleans, and House of Blues.</p><p>Over the past few years, FireBug have hosted the quarterly, and much sought-after, FIRELIGHT! Music Festival located in Silver Lake, the heart of Los Angeles’ hot new music scene.</p><p>FireBug plans the European release of their critically-acclaimed album, “Season for Change” this year in Europe. and they are already working on their next album with a planned worldwide release in the near future.</p><p>FireBug recent endorsements include:</p>UK based Hiwatt Amplifiers- http://www.hiwatt.co.uk/artists<br><br>Moody Leather Guitar Straps: (Featured Endorsement) http://www.moodyleather.com</div><canvas id=ParticleCanvas name=squaresmoz style="display: none;"></canvas><script src=http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js></script><script src=js/app.js></script><script>
